# **Project Cuirass**

# Executive Summary

As retailers/consumer demand increases for the availability of content in granularity, the ability to query existing content to meet that level of granularity must scale to survive. 
While expert content review and classification exists, today, there is a business need for increasing submission-based review processes, while maintaining the nuance of profile curation. 
Heuristic expertise is a necessary element in the process of catalog curation to make adjustments as profiles change and evolve over time and that marketable content is not being systematically rejected based on outdated/biased profile assumptions.  

Using machine learning tools, statistical processes, and the necessary element of iterative human experience, this workflow model provides a prototype for increasing the scalability of content submission workflows to employ machine learning models to predict a binary, ‘inclusion’ categorization (‘Flagged’/’Unflagged’), based on a historical dataset of hand-classified products by these same curators. 
This project provides a framework for ‘Human-in-the-loop’ classifier modeling that provides an iterative template to include machine learning and natural language processing models to predict selections informed and reformed by human audit and reclassification processes.

# Motivation

The digital age has created an abundance of content for consumers, and with the insertion of AI generated content, this trend will likely continue. 
While this creates an abundance of supply for content businesses, the availability of content has made it challenging for individual consumer, distributors, and retailers to find the products they desire or would like to sell, given the high number of substitutes available in the market.

To address this issue, businesses in the book industry are now using strategies such as curation and custom product selection to differentiate products based on consumer perception of quality and demand, both in general and niche markets.

This project provides a workflow model that uses statistical and machine learning predictive models that incorporate iterative/historical human product categorization to organize content submissions (and existing content) into smaller, segmented lists, resulting in granular, more queryable pools of content for curated selection and list generation, at scale. 





# Data Question

'Can human cataloged data be used to train a machine learning algorithm to catalog new observations to make quality cataloging decisions, at scale?'

# ‘Project Cuirass’

‘Project Cuirass’ is a workflow model that uses statistical and machine learning predictive models, integrating iterative/historical human product recategorization, to organize content into smaller, segmented lists, resulting in more manageable content pools for increased human scrutiny and list generation for downstream marketability.

This model will advocate for the inclusion of machine learning models, trained on historical product metadata, to predict the product ‘flags’ against new product metadata lists, reviewed by expert content curators. A reclassification process loop is included to increase the quality of historic classifications, informing the model.   

Continuous iteration and statistical bias transparency in manual cataloging processes ensure model refinement and scalability. Model uncertainty in product subjects provides elements for model re-training to increase predicted identification of content against specified parameters.

‘Flipped’ products are recorded for human review, ensuring additional transparency in reclassification.

# Known Issues and Challenges (pre-project)

Incorporating the human cataloging process ensures a high degree of human bias in what the machine learning model will predict for selection against larger lists. 

Defining the statistical and machine learning models, scoring metrics for each, and step-by-step stages in the workflow for model interpretation and execution will be a challenge, given these elements, however, the human expertise necessarily assists the model to keep the selections in check with customer/audience/review expectations in granularity and ensures viable content is not missed and therefore ‘underrepresented’, while the model assists the workflow operators by incorporating the human categorization to process new lists at scale.

The human touches in the beginning and the final stages of the workflow model are highly subjective, and internal methods of heuristic evaluation determine qualitative  ‘picks’ for final inclusion – therefore, having probability scoring lend to increased scrutiny of both the human cataloging, reliant on expertise of the cataloger, and the accuracy of the model predictions against the expected certainties at their maximum probabilities.
